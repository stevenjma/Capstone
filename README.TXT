PROJECT TITLE: BallGame
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To combine various concepts learned within the year to create a simple ball game,
including:
    - Loops 
    - Listeners
    - Drawing and Graphics
The major new concept researched into was the implementation of ball collision, as well as drawing black
walls properly and how such a thing would be properly implemented.
VERSION or DATE: Version 1.0 5/10/16
DEPENDENCIES:
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the void main(String [] args) method in GamerViewer.
AUTHORS: Steven Ma
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
The objective of the game is to guide your red ball to the green square using the arrow keys.
Once  you touch the square with the ball, press enter and you will be allowed to go to the next level.
When all the levels have been beaten, your screen will display that you have beaten the game.
Collisions with the black walls will reset the level to the beginning, forcing you to restart.
